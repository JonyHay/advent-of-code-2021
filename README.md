# advent-of-code-2021

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

These year I am taking part using something new whenever I have time for learning, and falling back on my staples of Java and Python when I don't.
